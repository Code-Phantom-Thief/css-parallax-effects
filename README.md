# css-parallax-effects

I learned from this project.

1: If title has letter-spacing, it saw more elegant. (For example, letter-spacing: 2px;)

2: If paragraph has line-height, it saw more elegant too. (For example, line-height: 1.8em;)

3: If I want to parallax effects in websites, I can use simpleparallax(https://simpleparallax.com/)
